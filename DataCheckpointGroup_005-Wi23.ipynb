    "### How Clean is Our Data?\n",
    "- The data is imperfect, but still usable after some cleaning. We see in the 'Age' column that there are outlier ages (like 8, 11, -1) which are likely due to the individual's freedom in inputting their age and human error in doing so. Furthermore, there are columns in which the data values are not uniform. For example, the gender column contains values like 'M', 'F', 'Female', 'female', 'mail', etc. In terms of variable relevance, some columns (like Timestamp) are unnecessary for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Our Data 🧼\n",
    "- To address some of the issues mentioned above, we took the following steps:\n",
    "    1. We dropped unnecessary variables (columns) from our dataset. We concurred that these variables were not relevant to our analysis:\n",
    "        - Timestamp\n",
    "        - State\n",
    "        - wellness_program\n",

    "        - phys_health_interview\n",
    "        - mental_vs_physical\n",
    "        - comments\n",
    "    2. We removed outliers in the 'Age' column. To do so, we took the lower .05% and upper .05% of the 'Age' range, which removed all ages below 18 and above 60. This addressed the issue of the extreme outliers and only took out 1% of our observations.\n",
    "    3. To address the lack of uniformity of the 'Gender' column, we replaced all values that didn't match 'M' or 'F' exactly with the appropriate labeling of either 'M', 'F', or 'NB' (Non-Binary).\n",
    "    4. After completing the above, we decided to adapt some of the columns with strictly Yes/No values to follow one-hot encoding. That is, we replaced 'Yes' values with a 1, and 'No' values with a 0 for ease of later calculations and analysis.\n",
    "    5. We then re-ordered the columns to place columns with string data (non-numerical values) at the beginning, and then put our one-hot encoded columns at the end. This is done for ease of interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pre-Processing Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- To come to our data-cleaning conclusions, we first looked at the dtypes of each column to ensure that qualitative values were represented as strings or objects and quantitative values were formatted as numerical representations.\n",
    "- Then, we looked at the values in each column individually. \n",
    "    - In doing so, we found the 'un-clean' formatting of the 'Gender' column as well as the outliers in the 'Age' column.\n",
    "    - We also found that some of the columns containing Yes/No values might serve us better if they were converted to 0/1 values, which is why we performed one-hot encoding\n"
